PURPOSE OF APPLICATION: Application purpose is to deliver packages in less than 140 miles utilizing the Nearest Neighbor aglorithim. A non-native data structure had to be used and created (no dictionaries in python allowed, hash table created instead to store packages as key value pairs). There was another unique challenge as there were 3 trucks and 2 drivers allowed so proper provisioning of the drivers was implemented (truck 3 aka truck_C could not leave until truck A or B was done with packages).
